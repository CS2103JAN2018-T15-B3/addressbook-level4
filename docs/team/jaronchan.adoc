== PROJECT: Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers

---

== Overview

Session Logger and Planner (SLAP) for Social Workers is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their schedule and contacts*. More importantly, SLAP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SLAP can get your daily scheduling and contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
It is a simple Java application intended for social workers to help them plan their day and keep track of their beneficiaries. Some key features of this application include secure sign-in, an address book, a calendar, a daily schedule display, user session logs and maps. Written in Java, it has about 15 kLoC.
